## What We're Working On Now

We're developing a web application for creating custom coloring books from photos. The project has a complete frontend and backend structure with most UI components implemented and API endpoints functional. We've recently added Clerk authentication, debugging endpoints for S3 file uploads, and implemented OpenAI API integration for image processing.

- Created UI components for the entire ordering process
- Implemented Node.js/Express backend with API endpoints
- Set up Docker and Docker Compose for local development
- Integrated LocalStack for S3 functionality

- **Implemented OpenAI API integration for image processing**
- **Optimized image processing to use base64 encoding for direct display**
- **Updated frontend to handle base64 image data for seamless previews**
- **Fixed file access issues between Docker containers using base64 data**

## Next Steps

1. Complete end-to-end testing of file uploads and processing
2. âœ… Implement OpenAI Image API integration for photo processing
3. Set up the PDF generation functionality for completed orders
