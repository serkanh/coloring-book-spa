# Active Context

## What We're Working On Now

We're developing a web application for creating custom coloring books from photos. The project has a complete frontend and backend structure with most UI components implemented and API endpoints functional. We've recently added Clerk authentication and debugging endpoints for S3 file uploads.

## Recent Changes

- Set up React frontend with Vite and TailwindCSS
- Created UI components for the entire ordering process
- Implemented Node.js/Express backend with API endpoints
- Set up Docker and Docker Compose for local development
- Integrated LocalStack for S3 functionality
- Configured controllers to handle uploads, orders, and user management
- Added Clerk authentication integration on frontend
- Created S3 debugging endpoints for verifying file uploads
- Updated documentation with debugging instructions
- Fixed compatibility issues with TailwindCSS configuration

## Next Steps

1. Complete end-to-end testing of file uploads and processing
2. Implement OpenAI Image API integration for photo processing
3. Set up the PDF generation functionality for completed orders
4. Implement database persistence for orders and user profiles
5. Add unit and integration tests
6. Configure proper environment variables for production deployment
7. Set up CI/CD pipeline (optional)
8. Implement real payment processing (optional)
9. Deploy the application to AWS
