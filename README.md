## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (for local development outside of Docker)
- Git
- OpenAI API key

### Environment Files

Before running the application, you need to set up the environment files. Example files are provided in the repository:

#### Backend Environment

1. Copy the example file to create your own:

   ```
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

2. Edit `backend/.env` to customize your settings:
   - Add your own OpenAI API key
   - Configure AWS credentials if using real AWS services
   - Adjust the minimum images required if needed
   - Set your Clerk API key

#### Frontend Environment

1. Copy the example file to create your own:

   ```
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
   ```

2. Edit `frontend/.env.local` to customize your settings:
   - Set your Clerk publishable key
   - Adjust the API URL if needed
   - Change the minimum required images if desired

The example files include all necessary configuration options with default values that work with the Docker setup.

### Running the Application

#### Full Stack (Docker Compose)

Run the entire application (backend, PostgreSQL, and LocalStack) with Docker Compose:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Access the application:

- Backend API: <http://localhost:8000/api>
- LocalStack (AWS services): <http://localhost:4566>
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

To view logs:

```
docker compose logs -f
```

To stop the application:

```
docker compose down
```

#### Frontend Only (Local Development)

If you want to run just the frontend locally while using the dockerized backend:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the frontend at:
   - <http://localhost:5173>

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- Authentication is handled by Clerk. The backend uses a simple middleware to validate authentication tokens.

### Uploads

- `POST /api/uploads/image`: Upload images
- `GET /api/uploads/status/:uploadId`: Get upload processing status
- `GET /api/uploads/presigned-url`: Get pre-signed URL for direct S3 upload
- `POST /api/uploads/process`: Process an image with OpenAI
- `GET /api/uploads/process/status/:jobId`: Get processing status, includes base64 image data when complete
- `GET /api/uploads/process/image/:jobId`: Get the processed image (fallback for non-base64 approach)
- `POST /api/uploads/process/confirm/:jobId`: Confirm processed image and upload to S3
- `DELETE /api/uploads/process/cancel/:jobId`: Cancel a processing job

### PDF Generation

- `POST /api/pdfs/generate`: Generate a PDF from a list of processed image URLs
- `GET /api/pdfs/status/:jobId`: Check the status of a PDF generation job
- `GET /api/pdfs/list`: List all PDFs generated by the current user

### S3 Debugging Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for debugging S3 connections in local development:

- `GET /api/uploads/debug/list-buckets`: List all S3 buckets in LocalStack
- `GET /api/uploads/debug/list-files/{bucket-name}`: List all files in a specific bucket
- `POST /api/uploads/debug/upload-test`: Upload a test file to verify S3 functionality

These endpoints don't require authentication, making it easy to test S3 integration directly.

### Orders

- `POST /api/orders`: Create a new order
- `GET /api/orders`: Get user's orders
- `GET /api/orders/:orderId`: Get order details
- `PATCH /api/orders/:orderId/status`: Update order status
- `POST /api/orders/:orderId/payment`: Process payment

### Users

- `POST /api/users/profile`: Create user profile
- `GET /api/users/profile`: Get user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile`: Update user profile
- `GET /api/users/downloads/:orderId`: Get download URL for completed orders

## Image Processing

The application uses the OpenAI Image API to convert photos to coloring book style. The process works as follows:

1. User uploads an image
2. Backend sends the image to OpenAI API
3. API returns the processed image as base64-encoded data
4. Backend returns this data directly to the frontend for immediate display
5. When confirmed, the image is stored in S3 for permanent storage
6. The base64 approach eliminates cross-container file access issues in Docker

## PDF Generation

The application generates PDF coloring books from the processed images:

1. User selects processed images and clicks "Create Coloring Book"
2. Frontend sends the list of image URLs to the backend
3. Backend retrieves images directly from S3 (not via HTTP)
4. PDFKit library is used to create a professional-quality PDF with:
   - Cover page including the book title
   - Page numbers
   - Properly sized and centered images
   - Instructions for coloring
5. The generated PDF is stored in S3
6. User receives a download link to the final PDF

The S3-direct approach ensures that images can be accessed reliably within Docker containers without relying on external HTTP URLs that might not resolve correctly in a containerized environment.

## Next Steps for Production

This application is nearly complete for image processing and PDF generation but still needs work in other areas. In a production environment, you would need to:

1. ✅ Implement actual integration with the OpenAI Image API for photo transformation
2. ✅ Implement PDF generation from processed images
3. Set up real AWS resources for S3 storage
4. Implement a real payment processing system
5. Configure Clerk with your own API keys
6. Complete the database integration for order storage
